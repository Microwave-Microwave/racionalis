# Racionalis - My Math Library

## Overview

Racionalis is a math library that originated from my interest in implementing a custom "BigInt" type. This type can theoretically store numbers with an infinite number of digits. I had to implemented various operations that real numbers can perform by nature. The project was quite enjoyable and educational. The main files, `racionalis.cpp` and `BigInt.cpp`, are the largest and contain the core functionality. I have also included several other math-related classes.

## Project Structure

- `racionalis.cpp`: Contains the primary implementation of the Racionalis library.
- `BigInt.cpp`: Contains the core logic for the BigInt type.
- Other files include different math-related classes and utilities.

## Imagery

Although I don't have any images to accompany this README, imagine your entire screen filled with digits representing a single number and various operations being performed on that number
